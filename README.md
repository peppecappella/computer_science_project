This repository contains my first Data Science project, focused on the manipulation and analysis of data related to dog adoption.
The project tackles several common challenges in the field of Data Science, such as managing compressed files, data cleaning, handling dates and strings, and exploratory analysis. Through the use of established Python libraries like pandas, numpy, nltk, and sklearn, basic data manipulation techniques are implemented, including reading CSV files from ZIP archives, cleaning and normalizing the data, and aggregating and grouping data for analysis.

A significant aspect of this project is the application of basic operations in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Utilizing NLP techniques, the project addresses the challenge of identifying duplicate records in the dataset by analyzing the similarity of the dogs' textual descriptions. This part of the project covers text cleaning, stopwords removal, text vectorization, and the computation of cosine similarity, showcasing how fundamental NLP operations can be effectively leveraged to enhance the quality of the dataset and yield deeper insights.
